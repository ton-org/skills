# TON Wallet Management

Manage the local wallet registry and perform advanced agentic wallet operations including import and key rotation.

## MCP Tools

### Wallet Registry

| Tool | Required | Optional |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| `list_wallets` | — | — |
| `get_current_wallet` | — | — |
| `set_active_wallet` | `walletSelector` | — |
| `remove_wallet` | `walletSelector` | — |

### Agentic Wallet Management

| Tool | Required | Optional |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| `agentic_validate_wallet` | `address` | `network`, `ownerAddress`, `collectionAddress` |
| `agentic_list_wallets_by_owner` | `ownerAddress` | `network` |
| `agentic_import_wallet` | `address` | `name` |
| `agentic_rotate_operator_key` | `walletSelector` | — |
| `agentic_complete_rotate_operator_key` | `rotationId` | — |

## Workflows

### Switch Active Wallet
1. Call `list_wallets` to see all stored wallets
2. Call `set_active_wallet` with a `walletSelector` (id, name, or address)
3. Confirm with `get_current_wallet`

### Import Existing Agentic Wallet
1. Call `agentic_validate_wallet` to verify the wallet address and contract
2. Call `agentic_import_wallet` to add it to the registry
3. If the agent needs to sign transactions and no operator key is available, call `agentic_rotate_operator_key` and then `agentic_complete_rotate_operator_key` after the user applies the key change on-chain via the dashboard

### Rotate Operator Key
1. Call `agentic_rotate_operator_key` — generates a new key pair and returns a dashboard URL for the user to apply the change on-chain
2. If local browser or shell tools are available, open the dashboard URL yourself; only send the raw link when automatic opening is unavailable or fails
3. Ask the user only to approve the on-chain key change in their wallet; do not require them to re-paste the URL or type a fixed confirmation phrase
4. Call `agentic_complete_rotate_operator_key` with the `rotationId`; if the chain state has not updated yet, wait briefly and retry instead of forcing extra user input

## Notes

- `walletSelector` accepts wallet id, name, or address
- For one-off queries, pass `walletSelector` directly to wallet-scoped tools instead of changing the active wallet
- Use available shell/browser tools to open dashboard URLs for the user whenever possible
- For confirmations and small option sets, prefer the host client's structured confirmation/choice UI when available; otherwise use a short natural-language yes/no prompt and never require an exact magic word
- Registry data is stored in `~/.config/ton/config.json` (or `TON_CONFIG_PATH`)
- Read tools work with imported agentic wallets that don't yet have an `operator_private_key`; write tools require it
- Management tool responses never expose private keys, mnemonics, or API keys
- To create a brand new agentic wallet, use the `ton-create-wallet` skill instead
